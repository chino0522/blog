Docker lets you package apps into containers. Kubernetes manages and scales those containers. Together, they streamline DevOps workflows with faster deployments and better scalability.

```bash
# Run a container
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx

# Deploy with Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
